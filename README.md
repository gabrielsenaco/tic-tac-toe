## On this project I...

I integrated HTML / CSS / JS to work synchronously in all parts of the application.

**JS was divided into 5 parts:**

- **storageController**
responsible for controlling localStorage
- **displayController**
responsible for controlling all changes in the page's html (the visual part)
- **gameBoard**
responsible for controlling all parts of the game and its settings
- **player**
responsible for playing the role of the normal player
- **aiPlayer**
responsible for playing the role of the AI player

**HTML**

HTML records visual information so that CSS can work on it.

**In short**

With this, I am able to synchronize several components in a simple and clean way, since each one has its share to take care of.
